          A Human Being's peace of mindis eclipsed, due to five vices like
          lust(kam), Anger(kridh), Temptation(moh), Jealousy and Hatred (Matsar)
          and Ego(Ahamkar). So, he/she needs enlightenment to get rid of these
          vices. The Saints do the noble mission to transform and modify the
          vices into virtues, through the prayer of God. They show the right
          path to us for heading a meaningful life. On23rd Feb. 1878 a
          omnipotent holly figure landed in Shegaon, none else but Shri Gajanan
          Maharaj. The two wise gentleman in shegaon Bankatlal and Damodar got
          attracted to a youth, who was almost all bare with radiant face,
          picking up the particles from the leftover food from the
          leaf-platters, at the door of Devidas Paturkar. Later he preferred to
          drink the ordinary water kept for cattle, without any hesitation and
          left the place. Looking at his queer actions, radiant glow and great
          philosophical wise speech, Bankatlal felt that he was not an ordinary
          man but had the noble qualities of Saints. Rest is the history Shegaon
          witnessed the omnipotent capacity and blessings of Shri Gajanan
          Maharaj.

                Once Shri Govind Maharaj Taklikar from Barshi - Takli had been
                at Mote Mahadeo Mandir(Lord Shiva's Temple) in Shegaon for
                Kirtan(Preaching in form of devotional songs and music) and he
                released that Shri Gajanan Maharaj, was a noble saint, as Shri
                Gajanan Maharaj, with his great capacities modified the fury and
                violent behavior of Takalikar Buwa's horse. Before the
                kirtanbegan, Bankatlal and Pitambar offerd Zunka-Bhakar, (A
                Traditional Maharastrian food in rural Part) to Shree. Later
                Pitambar was instructedby Shree to fetch some water from
                drainage and Lo! What a miracle! It was crystal clear water.
              </p>
              <p>
                Day by day Bankatlal was greatly inspired with spirituality,
                blessings and affection of Shree. He expressed his wish that the
                holy arrival of Shri Gajanan Maharaj should be destined at his
                home. When Shree gave green signal, Bankatlal bathed Him at his
                home, worshiped with all devotion and submitted himserj at the
                spiritual feet of Shree. So was his cusin- Ichcharam. Both
                became true devotees of Shree. Ichcharam was also very fortunate
                enough to have Maharaj at his home and he could warship Shree
                with all devotion at his home.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once Maharaj had a desire to ignite the pipe at early morning
                and hence needed light (fire). Some followers approached to a
                goldsmith - Jankirama. However, he denied. When the disappointed
                followers returned empty handed, Shree simply flashed smile and
                with his super natural capacity, ignited the pipe without fire
                by simply asking Bankatlal to hold the matchstick over the pipe.
                Later, on the auspicious occasion of Akshaya Trutiya, Jankiram
                had guests at his home but they were frowned to see the
                unhygienic food with worms. Consequently, the quests were
                reluctant to eat. Jankiram realized his blunder of not offering
                light for Shree. To rectify it, he sincerely apologized and
                started praying for Shree's blessings. The saints are always so
                generous to forgive. Maharaj blessed Jankiram and the worms in
                the food disappeared.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, many fortunate people witnessed the super natural capacity
                of Maharaj. Bhaskar Patil and the villagers were literally taken
                aback to see the miracle of Maharaj of producing steams of water
                into the dry well near Akoli-Adgaon (dist-Akola). Bankatlal
                invited Maharaj in his farm to relish corn. While Shree was in
                the farm, the honeybeeswere furious due to smoke of fire. To
                protect themselves, the followers fled away but the messenger of
                God i. e. Maharaj had no effect of restlessness due to fury of
                micro creatures. With His spiritual capacity, Maharaj was calm,
                and quit to stay there.Needless to say, how could the honeybees
                dare to cause any harm to the spiritual soul!
              </p>
              <p>
                Maharaj had taught a great lesson to renowned wrestler Shri.
                Hari Patil and blessed him to get rid of his ego and conceited
                nature. When, the young boys from Patil family gave blows of
                sugarcane to Maharaj in Maruti Mandir, the most benevolent holy
                figure i.e. Shree Maharaj squeezed sugarcanes without any
                machine and gave the juice to refresh those adamant boys who
                made blunder to beat him. His great capacity with yogic powers,
                had totally outwitted the conceited boys of Patil Family At
                onces all of them surrendered at the feet of Yogiraj. Khandu
                Patil was deeply sunk in the grief without son for many years.
                He was lucky enough to get blessed with a son with the blessings
                of Maharaj.
              </p>
              <p>
                A person called janrao was suffering with a disease for a long
                time. The medicine did not work. But the moment he was blessed
                with the Tirth (The holy water offered by Shree himself), Janrao
                had a speedy recorery. Similarly Laxman Ghude from Karanja
                (Dist. Washim) was offered Prasad ( A mango given by Shree
                himself) and it had much more better results than medicine to
                cure him. When medical science was not so develop, there was an
                epidemic of plague and many were victimized. But what a miracle!
                Shree blessed once such victim of plague - named Pundalik
                Bhokare. By simply the holy touch of Shree's thumb, in the
                underarm of Pundalik, he got rid of plague just within two days.
              </p>
              <p>
                A faithful devotee Pundlik Bhokre had great favors of destiny
                when Shree blessed him and gave his own footwear (Paduka), to
                Pundalik. Balakrushna and Putalabai from Balapur were faithful
                devotees of Samarth Ramdas. Shree appeared before both of them
                in the form of Samarth Ramdas. A poor devotee from
                Amravati-Ganeshaappa had a lifetime memory when Maharaj visited
                his home. On the holy day of Aashadhi Ekadashi (Land Mark Moment
                celebrated twice every year- Aashadhi and Kartiki Ekadashi in
                Warkari Sampradaya), Shree held his devotee-Bapuna Kale spell
                bound by appearing before him as Lord Vitthal in Pandharpur.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the holy occasion of Somavati Amawasya,Shree Maharaj had been
                at Omkareshwar (Madhy Pradesh) along with few devotees for holy
                dip in Narmada River. When they were sailing in boat, the
                devotees witnessed the most challenging breath taking moment.
                The water from Narmada encroached into the boat and the devotees
                felt the risk of submerging in the bed of Narmada. When they had
                given hope and started looking at Maharaj with an appeal to
                overcome the situation Shree simply remained calm and smiled at
                them. Goddess Narmada had an opportunity to pray the messenger
                of God. She appeared as simple fisherwomen and brought the boat
                at the shore. A devotee called Bandutatya was completely
                frustrated. But Shree gave him hint of the hidden wealth and
                saved him from committing the sin of suicide. Suklal's cow also
                had bad beper and violent habits. When cow brought before
                Maharaj, she gave up her fury and vices and at once submitted
                herself at the feet of Lord Gajanana. A boastful preacher-
                Bramhagiri was talking about great philosophy. Listening to that
                Maharaj sat on a burning cot and invited him for the same. The
                scared Bramhagiri immediately surrendered and begged pardon of
                Maharaj for his ego and hypocrisy
              </p>
              <p>
                A public meeting on the occasion ofShiv Jayanti (the birth
                anniversary of the great emperor- Shivaji Maharaj) had the two
                legend on the same platform- Shri Gajanan Maharaj and Lokmanya
                Tilak(A great freedom fighter). After the effective speech of
                Lokmanya Tilak, Maharaj made prophecy that the British rule in
                India shall declare the sentence of imprisonment of Tilak.
                Shree's words came true and Tilak was detained in the prison of
                Mandale (Myanmar). But, Shree's blessings and Prasad of Bhakari
                (Traditional preparation of Maharasthra, i.e. pancake of Jawar
                grain) had great favour on Tilak. In the prison, the
                extraordinary wisdom of Tilak gave birth to a landmark Book-
                Geeta Rahasya.
              </p>
              <p>
                Apart from this, many people witnessed grate spiritual power of
                Maharaj and his miracles such- to cure leprosy, to travel in
                women's compartment of train, to bring dead dog to life etc ( As
                per the authorized base of Shri Gajanan Vijay Granth).
              </p>
              <p>
                Maharaj used to chant the Bhajan(Devotional song) "Gani Gan
                Ganat Bote" and hence people started calling him Gajanan
                Maharaj. His devotees would offer him precious ornaments, rich
                clothes, money or eatables. But the one who was beyond all this
                material pleasure had no interest in it and so Maharaj would not
                touchanything of it. Even he would care neither for food nor for
                clothes. People would find him anywhere either lying or moving
                freely as per their desire. ('Paramahans'A state of divine
                quality).
              </p>
              <p>
                The moment he had the intuition of the order of the Almighty to
                conclude his incarnated life, Shri Gajanan Maharaj informed the
                devotees accordingly and on 8th Sept. 1910 went for eternal
                meditational in the proximity of God. While he was alive, i.e.
                he took Samadhi.

          Shruti and upanishandas have suggested the great ideology- 'Food is
          Bramha (God)' and it has the prime importance that all the organism on
          the earth originated from food, living on food and get lastly inserted
          in to food when they get dead. Therefore it also says that Annam Na
          Parichakshita whichmeans do not waste the food and do not insult it.
